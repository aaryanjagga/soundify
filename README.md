 🎧 Soundify — Music App
 
Soundify is a **frontend-only music app** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
It delivers a clean, modern listening experience with playlists, queue management, and full audio controls — all without any backend.

## ✨ Features

- ▶️ Play / Pause
- ⏭ Next & Previous track
- 🎚 Seek bar with live progress
- 🔊 Volume control & mute
- 🔀 Shuffle mode
- 🔁 Repeat (off / one / all)
- 📂 Multiple playlists
- 🔁 Smart queue system (Now Playing & Up Next)
- 🌙 Dark, responsive UI

## 🧠 How It Works

- Powered by the **HTML5 Audio API**
- Songs are loaded from a public `/audio` folder
- Playlists and queues are managed entirely in JavaScript
- No backend, no frameworks, no external APIs
